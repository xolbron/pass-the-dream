# The Story of DACA - A Country of Immigrants
*A TAU VR Creation*

## What is DACA?
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is a kind of administrative relief from deportation. The purpose of DACA is to protect eligible immigrant youth who came to the United States when they were children from deportation. DACA gives young undocumented immigrants:
1) Protection from deportation
2) A work permit. The program expires after two years, subject to renewal.

## What's the Issue?
This December, Congress can vote to change the fate of nearly two million young people in our country: Dreamers. They’re immigrants from all over the world who came here as children, but could soon lose their place in America.

If Congress doesn’t pass the Dream Act soon, these young people could be arrested, jailed, and deported out of the only country they have ever known. Our voices can help to change that, by calling our members of Congress, spreading the word on social media, and talking with friends and family this holiday.
